abstract="Historically, the concept of wavelets started to appear more frequently only in the early 1980s. This new concept can be viewed as a synthesis of various ideas originating from different disciplines including mathematics, physics, and engineering. One of the main reasons for the discovery of wavelets and wavelet transforms is that the Fourier transform analysis does not contain the local information of signals. So the Fourier transform cannot be used for analyzing signals in a joint time and frequency domain. In 1982, Jean Morlet, in collaboration with a group of French engineers, first introduced the idea of wavelets as a family of functions constructed by using translation and dilation of a single function, called the mother wavelet, for the analysis of nonstationary signals. Wavelet transforms are relatively recent developments that have fascinated the scientific, engineering, and mathematics community with their versatile applicability. The application areas for wavelets have been growing for the last 20 years at a very rapid rate. They have been applied in a number of fields including signal and image processing, sampling theory, turbulence, differential equations, statistics, quality control, computer graphics, economics and finance, medicine, neural networks, geophysics, astrophysics, quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and chemistry. For more information about the history and applications of wavelet transforms, the reader is referred to Daubechies (1992), Chui (l992), Meyer (1993a,b), Kaiser (1994), Cohen (1995), Hubbard (1996), Strang and Nguyen (1996), Burrus et al. (1997), Wojtaszczyk (1997), Debnath (1998a,b,c), Mallat (1998), Pinsky (2001), Ali et al. (2015), Gomes and Velho (2015), and Debnath and Shah (2015).",
